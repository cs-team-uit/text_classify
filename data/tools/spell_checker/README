This program was made as a prize winning solution for a programming contest called MobMe CodeJam. 
It is implemented using regular Hashtable as well as with the BloomFilter data structure.It is inpired from 
Peter Norvig's work on the same subject, which can be found here -> http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html.  
 
Dependancies(using Hashtable)
1. Dictionary used by spellchecker(dictionary.txt)
2. Word Database used by spellingsuggest(wordprobabilityDatabase)
3. Input Text File used by spellchecker(inputtext.txt)

Usage
Compile the source code($javac spellchecker.java) and then run its class($java spellchecker).
